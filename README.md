# GCM ANE V5.0.1 for Android+iOS
GCM ANE let's you use Google cloud messaging on Android and iOS to send push notifications (remote notifications) to your app users.

# Air Usage
```actionscript
import com.myflashlab.air.extensions.gcm.Gcm;
import com.myflashlab.air.extensions.gcm.GcmEvent;

// set this to false when you are using your production certificate. (this property must be set before you initialize the extension with new Gcm(...)
Gcm.isSandbox = true;

var _ex:Gcm = new Gcm(ANDROID_SENDER_ID, IOS_SENDER_ID);
_ex.addEventListener(GcmEvent.REGISTERED, onRegIdReceived);
_ex.addEventListener(GcmEvent.UNREGISTERED, onUnregistered);
_ex.addEventListener(GcmEvent.ERROR, onError);
_ex.addEventListener(GcmEvent.MESSAGE, onMessage);

trace("regId = " + _ex.getRegId); // will return null or an empty String if you have not registered yet

_ex.register();
//_ex.unregister();

function onError(e:GcmEvent):void
{
    trace("onError: ", e.param);
}

function onRegIdReceived(e:GcmEvent):void
{
    trace("onRegistered: ", e.param);
}

function onUnregistered(e:GcmEvent):void
{
    trace("onUnregistered: ", e.param);
}

function onMessage(e:GcmEvent):void
{
    trace("onMessage: ", e.param);
}
```

# Air Usage - InvokeEvent.INVOKE
```actionscript
NativeApplication.nativeApplication.addEventListener(InvokeEvent.INVOKE, onInvoke);

private function onInvoke(e:InvokeEvent):void
{
	NativeApplication.nativeApplication.removeEventListener(InvokeEvent.INVOKE, onInvoke);
	
	// on iOS, you will receive the GCM message as an object containing a parameter named "aps" which holds a string.
	// it's your job to parse that string and read it's information OR you can simply wait for the GcmEvent.MESSAGE event
	// to be called which 'usually' happen on iOS side when user opens the app by clicking the notification
	
	if (e.arguments.length > 0)
	{
		trace("The app has been run by clicking on the notification");
		
		try
		{
			var obj:Object = e.arguments[0];
			
			if (obj.aps)// we understand that this is coming for iOS
			{
				// extract the information we need. we are sending the gcm message including an "info" node. so we can get the "info" value like this.
				trace("info = " + e.arguments[0]["gcm.notification.info"]);
			}
		}
		catch (err:Error) // if it's not iOS, then it's Android.
		{
			var arr:Array = String(e.arguments[0]).split("://");
			trace(decodeURI(arr[1]));
		}
	}
}

# Tech Details
we have tried to make the AS3 API identical for both Android and iOS but there are still some differences which you should know about when implementing this extension in your project. I will explain these differences here. 

- The first difference is with how you can obtain the senderId and server API key from Google. we have written a complete step by step tutorial on how you can get those information check here http://www.myflashlabs.com/product/gcm-ane-adobe-air-native-extension/. once you have your senderID and server API key, implementing them in your project is identical. 

- The second difference is with the gcm message that your server will send to google servers. in simple words, you need to orgenize the gcm message in a json format and send the string to google gcm servers. check here http://myflashlabs.com/showcase/AIR_EXTENSIONS/GCM/demoV4/ and choose the device type from the dropdown menu. you will see a different json string for Android and iOS. I strongly recommand you to study the json strings and see what options are available to you if you are going to send gcm to an Android device or an iOS device. On the iOS side, we are limited with apple rules. I'm sorry to tell you that you can't imagine too much when working with GCM on iOS. To learn more about what parameters are supported on the iOS side, study the "notification-payload-support" section on this page http://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref#notification-payload-support. But on the Android side, you can do almost ANYTHING! 

    - Let me put it this way, **GCM on iOS:** is just a way for you to notify your users that something new is available for them so they can open your app and see what it is. But **GCM on Android:** is a way for you to remotly call on your app and do whatever you like with it! for example, maybe you need to update your app database with some very important information and you want to do this without engaging the user! you can simply send a gcm message to your app and trigger the function you like! Considering that GCM is so flexable on the Android side, we have customized the GCM payload Json message to what you can see here http://myflashlabs.com/showcase/AIR_EXTENSIONS/GCM/demoV4/. This format will allow us to add new tasks easily. these tasks must happen in native Java and not in flash. so, we have notification only at the moment but if you need background processes on the Android side, you can always contact us and put your order. Our Java dev team is ready to hear your requirements and we'll be happy to help you make them happen as fast as possible. 

- The third and the most difference between GCM in Android and iOS is with how much control you have over your gcm message. I explained a little about these controles above but let's take the notification as an example. On the Android side, you can fully control how your notification should appear. you can customize the notification icon, sound, content and many more details. we made sure we are supporting all the methods that native Android supports. small details like the notification LED color! While implementing all the latest notification features in the latest Android OS versions, we also made sure that everything will work fine on older Android versions begining from Android 2.3.6 

    - When sending a GCM on Android, you can specify an execution time. we are calling these gcm messages on Android as Tasks. so if you are on Android, you can always check which tasks are still in queue so maybe you wish to cancel their execution... you can also manually cancel a notification on Android. **on iOS side, gcm notifications will be cleaned automatically when you enter the application**.
	
- The last different between gcm extension for Android and iOS is with badges. on the iOS side, you can specify a badge number coming with your gcm message and as soon as the gcm message is delivered to your device, this badge number can be updated (you can update the badge manually from AS3 too). we don't have a similar thing on the Android side unfortunaitly.
